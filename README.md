- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial) - page router built by the Remix.js team
- [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/use-it/) - for handling international JS dates/timezones (should be migrated to [Luxon](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/))
- [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/) - customizable React chart components
- [MUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/) - for a few custom styled components
- [i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) - Javascript internationalization framework.
